                Features of Summer Season
                Among the four temperate seasons of the year, summer is the hottest season. The summer season usually runs between March and June in India, where the days are considered to be the longer and nights shorter. The weather is hot, humid and dry during this season, and temperature can rise extremely high in certain places, as the Earth tilts itself towards the Sun.
                
                As the Sun shines brightly in summer, this season is suitable for farmers to prepare for cultivation, and we get many seasonal fruits and vegetables. Let us see what sets the summer season apart from other seasons in this summer season essay.
                
                Activities during Summer Season
                The summer season is best enjoyed by children, as it is the time when they become free from academic activities and have days of endless play and mischief. Besides, summer is meant for travelling and children go with their families to some cool places or beaches to avoid the heat of the summer.
                
                Children and elders mostly spend their time indoors during the summer, and they engage in various activities and games to keep them entertained. It is also the best season to teach swimming and other water sports to children so that their minds and bodies remain fresh in the hot weather.
                
                In addition to these activities, children tend to eat ice cream and drink juices and smoothies, to keep themselves cool and hydrated. Mango is in abundance during this season, and we can see children on either the top of the mango tree, or standing beneath it to pluck and collect juicy mangoes. We also get other fruits like watermelon, guava, lychee, and jackfruit.
                
                Even though summer is the hottest season, most of us might try to enjoy the season to a great extent. Not only children but elders also find time to relax and rejuvenate themselves in the hot weather. With the Sun shining brightly over us, everything will seem perfect and happy. The summer season essay in English will thus be helpful for kids to plan their vacation and write about their experiences.

            <h1>WINTER</h1>
            <details>
                During winters, schools usually take a break and close down. The days are shorter and the nights get longer. The chilly mornings give you a different sense altogether. Hot drinks like coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are enjoyed more during winters. The sun rises quite late and sometimes it does not.

Even when it does, it doesn’t get a bit hot. People long for a little sunshine as the cold weather sends chills down the spine. You see people on the roads burning woods and paper to get a little warmth. However, not many people prefer going out in winters. They like sitting by the fireplace or heater all day.

In the hilly areas, people experience snow during winters. They have to shovel it out of the way to make way for walking. The essence of winters is enhanced by Christmas as well. It sets the holiday mood for people and is admired all over the world.

But, there is also a downside of this season. The farmers, homeless people, and animals are most affected by this season. There is hardly any business in this season for farmers. Hundreds of homeless people die due to the harsh winters.

As the animals do not have proper shelter, they too lose their lives. In addition, many flights are also canceled during this season. Nonetheless, this does not make winter any less important. It is quite essential to maintain balance in the weather of our country.

Why I Love Winter?
I personally love winters. This season brings a lot of healthy fruits and vegetables. People get the chance to eat fresh grapes, apples, carrots, cauliflower, guava and more. Furthermore, so many beautiful flowers bloom during this season. These flowers include roses, dahlias and more. This makes winter even more beautiful than it already is.

Other than that, no lizards are to be found as they go in hibernation. This makes me very happy and lets me live fearlessly. Most importantly, winter mornings are the best part of this season for me. I like getting up early in winters and witnessing the morning dew on flowers. There is a different vibe altogether that comes with winters.

Also, our school organizes bonfire which is one of the most awaited events of the year.

In short, winter is as important as any other season. Sure, it may have its negative sides and positive sides, but that happens with every season. Winters helps you enjoy long morning walks and fresh air.

The chirping of the birds in the early mornings and the buzzing of the bees in the night become very soothing and calm after a long winter's silence. The beauty of watching a butterfly hop from a flower to another in the gardens is wonderful. During this time, the skies appear clear and the wind is cool and refreshing, creating a peaceful atmosphere everywhere. A variety of flowers bloom in the spring season.
